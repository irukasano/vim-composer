# vim composer
Manage [composer](https://getcomposer.org) in Vim

```vim
:ComposerRun <args>
```
To run command for example `:ComposerRun validate` run command validate for your json

```vim
:ComposerGet
```
This command exec the installation flow of composer's install. This process require `curl`

```vim
:ComposerInstall [--no-dev ..]
```
This command exec `composer install`. Now you can attach after this command a custom callback to exec your personal flow.
```vim
function! MyCallbackFunction()
    exec ':silent ! ctags -a %'
endfunction
let g:composer_install_callback = "MyCallbackFunction"
```
In this example after every `composer install` I exec a ctags generation

```vim
:ComposerJSON
```
This command open `composer.json`


```vim
:ComposerKnowWhereCurrentFileIs
```
This function aims to help you to load files without using ctag. Grep current word inside composer autogenerated files, and if only one occurrence is found, opens file in another tab. If zero or more occurrences are found, simply echoes a string to advice you. To use this in your .vimrc file, just remap function. For example you can use:
map <F6>  :call ComposerKnowWhereCurrentFileIs()<CR>


## Install

Bundle 'vim-php/vim-composer'

## Force composer phar
This plugin support an autodetach test to check the correct path of composer.phar
If this check fails you can try to force correct path
```

```
